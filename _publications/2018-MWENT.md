title: "Distributions of degrees in growing graphs with loss of arcs"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-MWENT
excerpt: 'For growing graphs of preferential attachment that lose arcs continuously the problem of calculating the two-dimensional arcs (edges) degrees distribution is solved. The application of the developed methods for calculating graphs with arcs losses allows us to synthesize adequate models of growing networks (social, information-telecommunication, cooperation networks, etc.), taking into account the loss of connections between nodes.'
