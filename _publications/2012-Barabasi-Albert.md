title: "Structural properties of the scale-free Barabasi-Albert graph"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2012-Barabasi-Abert
excerpt: 'Consideration was given to the scale-free Barabasi-Albert graph describing large network structures of the Internet type. A fundamental graph matrix describing precisely the properties of the randomly selected edges was introduced and examined. The formula of the clustering coefficient was derived, and a method for its separable adjustment was proposed which does not affect the distribution of the local connectivity of vertices.'
