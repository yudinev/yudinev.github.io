title: "Calculation of number of motifs on three nodes using random sampling of frames in networks with directed links"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017-SSDSE
excerpt: 'A random sampling of frames method, based on a statistical approach, and an algorithm to estimate the occurrence of 3-motifs in networks with directed links is proposed. We suggest implementing the algorithm with the help of parallel computing. The results of numerical data experiments are given. When comparing the developed algorithm with other known algorithms its significant advantages in terms of accuracy, speed and consumption of RAM are revealed in some cases.'
