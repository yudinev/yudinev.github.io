excerpt: 'Paper proposes a model of large networks based on a random preferential attachment graph with addition of complete subgraphs (cliques). The proposed model refers to models of random graphs following the nonlinear preferential attachment rule, and takes into account the possibility of «adding» entire communities of nodes to the network. In the derivation of the relations that determine the vertex degree distribution, the technique of finite-difference equations describing stationary states of a graph is used. The obtained results are tested empirically (by generating large graphs), special cases correspond to known mathematical relations.'
