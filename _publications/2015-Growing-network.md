title: "Growing network: models following nonlinear preferential attachment rule"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-Growing-network
excerpt: 'We investigate the preferential attachment graphs proceeding from the following two assumptions. The first one: the probability that a new vertex connects to a vertex  is proportional to an arbitrary nonnegative function  of a vertex degree . The second assumption: a new vertex can have a random number of edges.'
